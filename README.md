## 📋 Workflow  

### 1. **Frontend (Next.js + Tailwind CSS)**  
   - Build an intuitive and responsive dashboard for image upload and visualization.  
   - Use dynamic styling with Tailwind CSS for seamless customization.  

### 2. **Backend (FastAPI)**  
   - Connect the frontend with FastAPI endpoints to process uploaded images.  
   - Perform inference using the YOLOv11 model to detect and label car parts.  

### 3. **YOLOv11 Model**  
   - Detect car parts with bounding boxes and classify them into predefined categories.  
   - Generate output in JSON format to be displayed on the dashboard.  

### 4. **Visualization**  
   - Render detected parts with bounding boxes on the uploaded image.  
   - Provide users with options to review, modify, or confirm labels.
